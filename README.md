# BitFS Final Speed Transfer Brute Forcer
A GPU-based brute forcing tool to search for working setups for the FST step of the BitFS 0xA TAS. 

This is the original version of the brute forcer used to find 10k PU routes, including the one in my Complete BitFS Upwarp Blueprint Demonstration video. However, this approach didn't consider a lot of factors that are important for an actual FST setup, and thus produces many invalid solutions. So, this version of the brute forcer is not actively maintained and it isn't recommended that you try and find solutions with it. However, the code is still available here for reference purposes.
