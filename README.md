# BitFS Final Speed Transfer Brute Forcer
A GPU-based brute forcing tool to search for working setups for the FST step of the BitFS 0xA TAS. 

This version of the brute forcer searches for low speed freefall 10k PU routes. This type of setup is not considered likely to work, so this version of the brute forcer is not actively maintained and it isn't recommended that you try and find solutions with it. However, the code is still available here for reference purposes.
